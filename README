Description
===========
flashpaper2pdf is a script i wrote to convert some old documents to PDF

Requirements
============
Linux/Unix machine with:
- Xvfb
- xdotools
- imagemagick
- gtk-gnash

How does it work?
=================
The script takes a bunch of arguments:
- swf filename
- prefix for images and pdf file created
- first page to convert
- last page to convert

It does the following things:
- create a virtual x11 display using Xvfb (size 1500x2048)
- open the swf document using gtk-gnash with scaling = 4 (fixed)
- gets the id of the created window
- for each page in the specified range:
  - move the mouse to the zone of the page nr
  - click on it
  - delete content and enter page nr
  - takes a snapshot of the gtk-gnash window
  - crop the image to remove decorations and headers
- assemble all pages in a pdf file named after the image file prefix
- delete the temporary files

Example
=======
To convert page 1 to 50 of the "this_nice_presentation.swf" to "present.pdf"

  ./flashpaper2pdf this_nice_presentation.swf 1 50 present


Known bugs/limitations
======================
- Xvfb display is always :1
- name of the swf must not contain any escaped character (breaks some commands)
- borders cropping is hard-coded
- sometimes images gets broken - convert small chunks of document at a time and verify the output
- assumes position of the page field in gtk-gnash
- files with the name of the temp images are removed
